## Voices
### Accessing your List of Available Voices
To retrieve your list of accessible Voices, you can statically utilize `Voice#getVoices()`. This will return both ElevenLab's pregenerated `Voice` models, as well as any personal `Voices` you have generated.
```java
List<Voice> voices = Voice.getVoices();
```

### Accessing the Default Voice Settings
ElevenLabs provides a default `VoiceSettings` configuration which can be accessed statically from `VoiceSettings#getDefaultVoiceSettings()` **This is a network request**.
```
VoiceSettings.getDefaultVoiceSettings();
```

### Getting a Voice by ID
Retrieving voices via their `voiceId` can be done in a few different ways.

The first retrieves a `Voice` by `voiceId` and by default includes the settings. 
```java
Voice.get(String voiceId);
```


If you don't wish to retrieve the `Voice` model with its default settings included, you can use the `Voice#get(String voiceId, boolean withSettings)` function. By specifying `false` for `withSettings`, you will receive a voice object without its default `VoiceSettings`. (They can be loaded later with `Voice#fetchSettings()`, or not at all by providing a `VoiceSettings` object when generating TTS)
```java
Voice.get(String voiceId, boolean withSettings);
```

### Deleting a voice
To delete a `Voice`, you can utilize the `Voice#delete()` function. This will delete a voice from the ElevenLabs API.
```java
Voice voice;
voice.delete();
```

### Retrieving an Updated VoiceSettings for a Voice
There may be times when the default `VoiceSettings` parameters are changed externally from the API (Via the main website or another integrated system), to retrieve and apply the most up to date `VoiceSettings` object to a `Voice`, you can use the `Voice#fetchSettings()` function. (This is a network request, and it updates the object you're acting upon)
```java
Voice voice;
voice.fetchSettings(); // requests updated settings from ElevenLabs
```

### Updating the VoiceSettings for a Voice
A `VoiceSettings` object can be modified and updated in a `Voice`.
The `Voice#updateVoiceSettings(VoiceSettings settings)` function updates the **default** voice parameters to use when generating speech. (This is a network request, and updates the object you're acting upon.)
```java
Voice voice;
voice.updateVoiceSettings(VoiceSettings settings);
```

### Editing a Voice
To edit an existing `Voice` model, you can load the `Voice` into a `VoiceBuilder` with the `VoiceBuilder#fromVoice(Voice voice)` function.
The `fromVoice(Voice voice)` function will add all the current values stored in a `Voice` object directly into the `VoiceBuilder`. (Meaning you do not have to redefine existing settings) 

You'll also see that the **Creating a Voice** section utilizes this same `VoiceBuilder` class, except it uses the `VoiceBuilder#create()` function, instead of the `VoiceBuilder#edit()` function.

When editing a voice, you **must** use `VoiceBuilder.edit()`

```java
Voice voice;
VoiceBuilder builder = VoiceBuilder.fromVoice(voice); // load the existing voice into the builder
builder.withLabel("key", "value"); // add a new label
builder.removeLabel("oldKey");
builder.withFile(new File("someAudioFile.mp3")); // add a new audio sample
voice = builder.edit(); // edit voice & return updated voice object
```

### Creating a Voice
To generate a new `Voice` model from the API, you can use the `VoiceBuilder` class to assemble the required parameters for a `Voice` model.
Some things to remember:
- All `Voice` objects must have a name. (There can only be ONE name for a `Voice`)
- At least 1 file (`Voice` Sample) must be provided with `VoiceBuilder#withFile()`
- Labels are not required, but are helpful. As many labels as you like may be applied to a `Voice`.
```java
Voice voice;
VoiceBuilder builder = new VoiceBuilder();
builder.withName("Voice name");
builder.withFile(new File("sample1.mp3"));
builder.withFile(new File("sample2.mp3"));
builder.withLabel("accent", "American");
voice = builder.create();
```

### Generating Audio
To generate an audio file with a given `Voice`, you can utilize the `Voice#generate(...)` functions.
Depending on how you access your `Voice`, (with or without settings), will decide whether you can use the implicit `voiceSettings` or if you have to specify the `VoiceSettings` object to use. Unless explicitly requesting the `Voice` without settings, every `Voice` object SHOULD contain its default `VoiceSettings`.
```java
Voice voice;
File file = voice.generate(String text);
File file = voice.generate(String text, VoiceSettings settings);
File file = voice.generate(String text, String model, VoiceSettings settings);
File file = voice.generate(String text, String model);

InputStream inputStream = voice.generateStream(String text);
InputStream inputStream = voice.generateStream(String text, VoiceSettings settings);
InputStream inputStream = voice.generateStream(String text, String model, VoiceSettings settings);
InputStream inputStream = voice.generateStream(String text, String model);
```

## Samples
A `Sample` is used as the training data for a given `Voice` model.
### Accessing Voice Samples
To access the sample(s) for a given `Voice`, you can utilize `Voice#getSamples()`.
```java
Voice voice;
List<Sample> samples = voice.getSamples();
```
### Downloading a Sample
You can download a `Sample` via the `Sample#downloadAudio(File outputFile)` function.
The `File` parameter of `downloadAudio()` is the location of where you want to locally download the sample.
```java
Voice voice;
File file = voice.getSamples().get(0).downloadAudio();
```

### Deleting a Sample
Deleting a `Sample` is easy. This action makes a network request. 
```java
Sample sample;
sample.delete();
```

## History
Your ElevenLabs `History` is a collection of all of your previous TTS generations.
### Getting Generation History
To get your ElevenLabs generation `History`, you can utilize `History#get()`. (You can also retrieve your `History` from a `User` object, with `User#getHistory()`)
```java
History history = History.get();
```

### Getting a History Item
To retrieve a `HistoryItem` from your `History`, you can use `History#getHistoryItem(String itemId)`.
```java
History history;
HistoryItem item = history.getHistoryItem("itemId");
```

### Downloading History
The official API of ElevenLabs provides an endpoint for downloading multiple `HistoryItem`'s as a ZIP file. To download such items, you can pass a `String[]` containing the `HistoryItem` IDs, OR you can provide a `List<HistoryItem>` parameter. 

```java
History history;
File download = history.downloadHistory(new String[]{"item-id1", "item-id2"});
File download = history.downloadHistory(List<HistoryItem> historyItems);
```

### Deleting a HistoryItem
You can utilize the `HistoryItem#delete()` function to delete a `HistoryItem` from ElevenLabs.
```java
HistoryItem item;
item.delete();
```

### Requesting the Voice for a HistoryItem
By default, a `HistoryItem` contains the `voiceId` of the `Voice` used to generate it. The `getVoice()` function will send a request to the ElevenLabs API to retrieve the voice object. (See also `Voice.get()` and `Voice.getVoices()`)
```java
HistoryItem item;
Voice voice = item.getVoice();
```

### Downloading a HistoryItem Audio
A `HistoryItem` is a previous TTS generation. You can download the generation as an MP3 file by executing the `downloadAudio()` function. The return value is the tmp `File` location of your download.
```java
HistoryItem item;
File file = item.downloadAudio();
```

## User Management

### Getting your Subscription
A `Subscription` contains all the relevant data to manage your API usage (character usage, next billing cycle, etc.) 
```java
Subscription subscription = Subscription.get();
```

### Getting your User
This endpoint will return the `User` associated with a given API key.
```java
User user = User.get();
```

## Exceptions
### *ElevenLabsValidationException*
This error indicates a malformed request to the ElevenLabs API. The exception should provide the location of any syntactically incorrect parameters within the request.

- - -

## Misc
As specified on the official ElevenLabs API Documentation, their API is experimental and all endpoints are subject to change. Depending on how they modify their API, may break this library. Should you notice any API changes / library errors, feel free to submit an issue or a PR.

If you like what you see, give it a star! :)
